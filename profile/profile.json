Once installed on each node, the monitoring agent automatically gathers hardware information and resource usage data from the server, storing it in a PostgreSQL database provisioned with Docker. Resource usage is obtained periodically using Crontab every minute, and the collected data can be manipulated through SQL queries. To ensure efficient code review and collaboration among team members, I implemented Git for version control and utilized GitHub as the central repository for the project, enabling effective code review and collaboration among team members.",
