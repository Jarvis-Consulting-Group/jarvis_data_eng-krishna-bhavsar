# Krishna Bhavsar . Jarvis Consulting

I, Krishna Bhavsar, am an experienced Python Developer with more than 4 years in web application development, proficient in Python, JIRA/Confluence, AWS Web services, MSSQL Server, Docker, GitHub, REST/SOAP API, Fast API and integration. I have recently completed the gradutaion from University of Guelph that enhance my knowledge in area of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I worked on a variety of challenging AI projects during my master's program, giving me the chance to have first-hand exposure with cutting-edge technologies. I utilize my abilities by developing effective and efficient software systems at Jarvis Technologies Group Inc., where I am presently employed as a software developer. I am interested in both data engineering and programming opportunities since I enjoy working in a team atmosphere. I am rapidly improving my Java skills while becoming adept in Python to further expand my skill set. I'm excited to be a part of a productive software development team, and I'm looking forward to the challenges and benefits that come along with it.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-krishna-bhavsar](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-krishna-bhavsar)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-krishna-bhavsar/tree/master/linux_sql)]: I created a Cluster Monitor Agent utilizing bash scripts, which enables users to monitor and save hardware specifications and usage data for multiple Linux systems. Once installed on each node, the monitoring agent automatically gathers hardware information and resource usage data from the server, storing it in a PostgreSQL database provisioned with Docker. Resource usage is obtained periodically using Crontab every minute, and the collected data can be manipulated through SQL queries. To ensure efficient code review and collaboration among team members, I implemented Git for version control and utilized GitHub as the central repository for the project, enabling effective code review and collaboration among team members.


## Highlighted Projects
**Weapon Detection using Image Segmentation and Object Detection**: I performed dataset generation, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data modeling for weapon detection by implementing a fine-tuned model using Tensorflow Object Detection API. Subsequently, I utilized Postman to predict the weapon detected in region of interest on live stream by deploying the trained model and providing unseen data for prediction.

**Customer Wait time using Person Detection and Tracking**: I developed an backend Restful API using Flask, that can handle the microservices related to object detection and tracking. I have performed the transfer learning on RapiD object detection model based on yolov3 that can perform the detection on fisheye camera. Followed by, detection results is used by tracker to track the person in frame to calculate the wait time. For the front-end, I utilized React to create an interactive user interface.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2023-present)**: I am a member of a collaborative team at Jarvis Technologies, where we work together to design, develop, and implement software systems. My expertise in Python and Java allows me to write high-quality, efficient, and scalable code. I use the tools like Docker, Linux/Bash, Git, and GitHub to manage the software development process and ensure the reliability of the code. My main focus is on delivering software features that meet the requirements, and I always stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices. I actively participate in Agile development processes, following the Scrum methodology to meet project deadlines and deliver high-quality software solutions.

**Python Developer, IT Pros (Oct,2021-Feb,2023)**: I successfully managed the backend infrastructure of a deep learning based project, taking charge of API development using the Django framework and leveraging PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and management. Collaborating closely with senior developers and actively engaging with clients, I excelled in gathering requirements and implementing effective error handling strategies to ensure seamless project execution.
